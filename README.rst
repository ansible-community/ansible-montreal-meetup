ansible-montreal-meetup
=======================

This repository holds interesting data about the `Ansible Montreal`_ meetup.
It is inspired by the work of `keithresar`_ for the `Ansible Minneapolis`_
meetup.

It turns out that organizing and managing a meetup is much easier when involving
the community.

Ultimately, the attendees know best what they would like to hear about.
We'd like to hear your ideas and opinions on what should be in the next meetup!
